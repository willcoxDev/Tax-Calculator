Email validation. I used a regex to check for valid emails. It should encompass almsot all valid western email addresses.

Since there is no database component to this everything is wiped after the program closes, except for the pdfs that were created. Therefore Employee IDs could be duplicated and changed depending on the order the employees were entered on that run. I thought about adding employees ID to a text file however it was not part of the scope and A quick look at Module 9 shows that the next project will envolve a similar project with a database component so I can do it on that instead.

If I were to do this project again, I would defintely refactor some of the code. I tried to plan as best I could before I started coding but mistakes were made...

All said and done it is a fully functional program that acheives the goals set for the prohect given in Module 8.

I have this project uploaded to github so I could exercise proper version control.
